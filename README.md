PKPDsim is a library for numerical integration of ODE systems, in particular pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) mixed-effects models.

## Installation

The development version of PKPDsim always has the most up-to-date improvements
and bug fixes. We aim to release PKPDsim on CRAN at least once a year,
depending on the number and impact of updates made to the development version.

The CRAN version of PKPDsim can be installed using:

```
install.packages("PKPDsim")
```

The development version of PKPDsim can be installed using:

```
devtools::install_github("InsightRX/PKPDsim")
```

A number of models from the literature have been made available for use in
PKPD simulations. To see which models are available for installation, run:

```
available_default_literature_models()
```

You can install these models as packages using the following commands:
```
# To install a single model:
install_default_literature_model("pk_busulfan_mccune")
# To install all supplied models:
install_default_literature_model("all")
```
