PKPDsim is a library for numerical integration of ODE systems, in particular pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) mixed-effects models.

## Installation

The development version of PKPDsim always has the most up-to-date improvements
and bug fixes. We aim to release PKPDsim on CRAN at least once a year,
depending on the number and impact of updates made to the development version.

The [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=PKPDsim) version of PKPDsim can be installed using:

```r
install.packages("PKPDsim")
```

The development version of PKPDsim can be installed from [GitHub](https://github.com/InsightRX/PKPDsim) or [R-universe](https://insightrx.r-universe.dev/PKPDsim) using:

```r
# Install from GitHub:
devtools::install_github("InsightRX/PKPDsim")

# Install from R-universe:
install.packages("PKPDsim", repos = "https://insightrx.r-universe.dev")
```

A number of models from the literature have been made available for use in
PKPD simulations. To see which models are available for installation, run:

```r
available_default_literature_models()
```

You can install these models as packages using the following commands:

```r
# To install a single model:
install_default_literature_model("pk_busulfan_mccune")

# To install all supplied models:
install_default_literature_model("all")
```
