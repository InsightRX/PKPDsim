\title{Pipe/chain an object forward into a function call/expression.}
\usage{
lhs \%>\% rhs
}
\arguments{
\item{lhs}{a value}

\item{rhs}{a function/call/expression. Enclose in parentheses to force
evaluation of rhs before piping is carried out, e.g. anonymous functions
or call-generating expressions.}
}
\value{
The result of evaluting the right-hand side with the left-hand side
as the specified argument(s).
}
\description{
The \code{\%>\%} operator pipes the left-hand side into an expression on the
right-hand side. The expression can contain a \code{.} as placeholder to
indicate the position taken by the object in the pipeline. If not present,
it will be squeezed in as the first argument. If the right-hand side
expression is a function call that takes only one argument, one can omit
parentheses and the "\code{.}". Only the outmost call is matched against the
dot for the purpose of deciding the on placement of the left-hand side.
Using the "\code{.}" in nested calls/functions is also possible, but magrittr
will not try to book-keep the call in this case, which can be useful at
at times, see e.g. a plotting example below where labels change.

# Here, "." is used in a nested call to show how the call is not preserved
# in this case. It is visualized by noting the y-axis label.
1:10 \%>\% plot(., col = .)      # not nested
1:10 \%>\% plot(I(.), col = .)   # nested.

# This examples shows how the placement of the lhs is independent of
# using . in a nested call:
1:10 \%>\% rep(.)     # like rep(1:10)
1:10 \%>\% rep(I(.))  # like 1:10 \%>\% rep(., .) and rep(1:10, 1:10)
}
